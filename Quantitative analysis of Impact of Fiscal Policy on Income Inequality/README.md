# Project Name: Quantitative analysis of Impact of Fiscal Policy on Income Inequality

This project aims to study the impact made by fiscal policies in reducing income inequality. It involves collecting and processing data from various government resources to build time series models based on ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). The project also includes two separate time series models: one to capture the general trend using previous data and another to isolate the trend specifically caused by the implemented fiscal policies. The difference between these two models is analyzed to understand the impact of the policies on income inequality. The introduction of Casual Impact by google has made it even more efficient to analyse the true impact of a certain policy

## Introduction

Income inequality is a pressing issue in many societies, and fiscal policies play a crucial role in addressing this disparity. This project aims to analyze the impact of fiscal policies on income inequality by employing time series analysis techniques. The project involves collecting data from various government resources, processing it, and building ARIMA models to study the general trend and the specific impact caused by implemented policies.

## Data Collection and Processing

The project relies on data collected from various government resources. The data collection process involves accessing and retrieving relevant datasets related to income distribution, fiscal policies, and other socio-economic factors. Once collected, the data is preprocessed to ensure consistency, handle missing values, and create suitable time series datasets. The Polynomial Extrapolation is also carried out on the final dataset.
## ARIMA Models

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models are used to analyze the time series data. Two separate ARIMA models are employed:

1. **General Trend Model**: This model captures the general trend in income inequality over time using historical data. It provides insights into the overall pattern and behavior of income inequality.
2. **Policy Impact Model**: This model isolates the specific impact of implemented fiscal policies on income inequality. By using complete data, it allows the analysis of the changes caused by the policies and their effectiveness in reducing income inequality.

The difference between the predictions of the general trend model and the policy impact model is studied to understand the direct influence of fiscal policies on income inequality.

## Enhancing Model Accuracy

To increase the accuracy of the models, the project focuses on collecting and synthesizing additional data points that may impact income inequality. This includes exploring additional socio-economic indicators, demographic data, and policy-specific information. By incorporating more relevant features into the models, we aim to improve their predictive power and provide more accurate insights.

## Casual Impact

Causal impact refers to the quantification of the causal effect of a specific intervention on an outcome metric over time. In the context of econometrics and marketing, understanding the impact of market interventions (such as advertising campaigns) is crucial for making informed decisions and optimizing resource allocation. It is a novel approach for inferring causal impact using a diffusion-regression state-space model. This model predicts the counterfactual market response, which represents what would have happened in the absence of the intervention. By comparing the actual outcome with the counterfactual prediction, one can estimate the causal impact of the intervention.
