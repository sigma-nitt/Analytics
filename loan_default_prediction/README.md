# Loan Default Prediction
Defaulting on a loan is a major concern for both individuals and businesses. Loan default prediction is the practice of assessing the risk of a borrower not repaying a loan or credit. Lenders use a variety of factors to determine this risk, including credit score, income and employment history, debts, and assets.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of loan default based on borrower information. The data used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and includes information such as borrower credit score, income, and loan type.

## Data
The data used in this project is available in the Loan_Default_Data.csv file. It includes information on ~50,000 loans and their associated borrowers. The data has been preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables have been encoded as numerical values.

## Methodology
+ The first step in this project was to perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or trends. This included visualizations such as histograms, scatterplots, and correlation matrices.

+ Next, the data was split into training and testing sets and various machine learning algorithms were applied to the training data. These included logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

+ The best performing model was then selected and tuned using grid search to further improve its performance.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 96.41% on the testing data, with a precision of 0.94, recall of 0.93, and F1 score of 0.93. This indicates that the model is able to accurately predict loan default in the majority of cases.

## Conclusion
Loan default prediction is an important practice for lenders and borrowers alike. By developing an accurate machine learning model, lenders can better assess the risk of default and make more informed decisions about loan approvals and terms. Borrowers can also use this information to better manage their finances and reduce the risk of defaulting on their loans.
