You will see that I have 0 delinquencies because I hold my credit in such high regard.<br><br>I am ALWAYS ON TIME with my payments, as I have complete respect for my credit score, because I know how important it is for family (being able to provide housing, transportation, etc etc).<br><br>Again, thanks for looking at my loan. If you invest in my loan, I will ALWAYS be one of your &quot;Current&quot; notes!<br>\n",

      "  Borrower added on 12/09/11 >  There are three primary purposes for this loan:<br><br>1. To pay off an old loan with an unfavourably high APR of 24.99%. The payoff amount for this loan is $4,039 (as of 12/22/11, the date this loan would potentially fund).<br><br>2. For home repairs. My condo received some water damage during Hurricane Irene, which was worsened by rain storms during the following months. The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.<br><br>3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!<br><br>I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems. It is also worth noting that I share my condo, so mortgage and bills are split, giving me a comfortable buffer in my disposable income to cover payments on this loan without any adverse affects.<br><br>Thank you in advance for your consideration!<br>\n",

      "Thank you for considering investing your money in my loan.  While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.  You make money, I save money and credit card companies lose money. win-win!\"\n",

      "Hi! This loan is for working capital for a whiskey bar and music venue. We feature drinks and cocktails that hearken back to the Prohibition and Big Band eras, in a return to the elegance of that time. We are the only bar in several towns with a full-size music stage, and we feature at least one band every weekend (mostly blues, bluegrass and rockabilly, although we have had other styles in). We would like to expand into having bands every Friday and Saturday night, as well as an open mic during the week. The owner has experience running a tavern, and he has tons of great ideas for expansion. In addition, he has created jobs for eight other people by starting this business, to say nothing of supporting local bands. The business is up and running, but we are in need of working capital for things like advertising and paying for bands. It is a classy place, and we're already starting to make a name for ourself in our town. We're doing our part to revitalize our downtown area. The owner is already a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and we participate in city chamber events. I have been at my job for over fourteen years, so our ability to repay is secure. We just need some capital to really get things up off the ground. Thank you so much for considering our loan<br> Borrower added on 12/08/11 > We would also like to open the kitchen up and serve appetizers and snacks. There is a full kitchen, with no equipment.

So, as I mentioned in the title, I pretty much have free reign to do as I please.  It's been a <br><br>year now and it's time to get moving on it; there's 2000 square feet of nothingness back there.  I've applied the <br><br>appropriate herbicides to clear the wild brush and I've tilled and turned most of the land myself.  Now I need materials <br><br>and resources.  I'm currently taking bids for small pools.  Not sure if I'll go that route as they can get quite expensive, <br><br>but it's a bit of a dream.  I'm definitely doing a paverstone covered patio and some serious landscaping.  A moderate <br><br>fountain/pond is in the plans, as well. <br><br>I'm a good borrower because the trend of my life over the past five years would indicate such.  Five years ago, my credit <br><br>score was very poor.  It's currently plenty good enough for my listing to be accepted.  I've worked very hard since a short <br><br>tenure of financial ignorance to establish my creditworthiness.  I keep track of every dollar.  I can tell you the <br><br>remaining balances on all my debts, when payment on them is due, and the minimums required.  <br><br>I'm comfortable in the $650.00 payment range.  The initial lending club offer when I submitted my data was $25000.00 for <br><br>five years, paying $638.00 monthly.  I chose the alternate three-year, $20000.00 offer, paying $668.00 payment because it <br><br>just seemed like a better situation for all, including investors.<br><br>I've been in the same industry for four years now.  Work is stable and is expected to be for some time to come.<br><br>Thank you all for your consideration.  I'll try to answer any questions quickly and effectively.  <br>\n",

I received a loan through lending club back in May to help with one part of my debt consolidation plan.  As I have moved forward some teaser rates have expired on my cards and interest rates are really bogging me down in trying to get ahead on the revolving debt.<br><br>I, like many others have had some big expenses (unforseen), and took advantage of some teaser rates to try and get ahead.  I did not accomplish what I set out to do.  So I am reaching out to the lending club community again.  I have tried (unsuccessfully) to negotiate with the banks, but they really won't budge at this juncture.<br><br>My plan is to consolidate 2 cards 1 with $7,000 (approx) outstanding and 1 with about $5,500 outanding into 1 payment (Lending Club) whereby the monthly amount I am paying back will be less than the monthly revolving.<br><br>I have been employed for 6 years and have a steady job at BOA.  I also plan to use any tax returns, etc to help accelerate paying this and my other debts off early.<br><br>I have paid every lending club payment on-time and will continue to do so.  Again, I would much rather take out the middle man and have a fixed amount to pay with a fixed term (this ensures I do not fall into this trap again).  Also, I have cut up the cards and have reverted to a strict budget with a &quot;cash&quot; only philosophy.  <br><br>Thank You again for your time and consideration!<br> Borrower added on 11/26/11 > Additional information...I have a 1900 month mortgage (waiting for HARP 2 for a possible refinance), 400 a month car payment, plus the revolving and utilities.  Consolidating this will give me the peace of mind of having a fixed amount over a fixed period.  <br>\n",

I made a mistake in having too many credit cards and I simply do not wish to go down that route again. With the situation of banks right now, they do not want to lend a large dollar amount to anyone regardless of credit history. I have always kept above a 720 credit score for as long as I have had credit history. More recently it has come down slightly, not because I have been late or anything, but because my balances are high. I ALWAYS pay my bills on time and have NEVER had any late or delinquent payments. I am a worthy borrower not only because of my credit history, but because I also believe that if you spend it, you must pay it back. I personally do not believe in not paying my bills. I have a full time VERY stable job and make decent money, the minimum payment on this loan is actually less than my minimum payments per month on all of my current credit cards, so there is no problem in you getting your investment back plus interest. I regard my credit scores very highly and I would not jepordize my credit history because I just decided I did not want to pay for things I purchased, that is quite immoral. I would simply like to have one payment and close out all the little cards so I can have a little piece of mind. Thank you for your consideration.<br>\n",

Also, we are paying a higher monthly amount on a car loan. By consolidating the car loan with the home improvement loan, we are aiming at having just one lower, comfortable monthly payment for both things.<br><br>I've been at my current employer's  for over 15 years. Since we've been advised to do the remodels to the home before we move in, we are still in our rental. In the area of expenses, I'm currently paying $1,250 in rent (last rent payment will be in Dec. 2011) and $573 on our car loan. Our only debts are the car loan (we only have one car) and our brand new mortgage of just under $650 (principal and interest). Our first mortgage payment is due in Jan 2012. By paying off the car loan and consolidating this amount with the home improvement amount, I will only have to pay $548 for my full loan with Lending Club. This means that it will be easy for me to pay back the loan without any problems at all.<br><br>In the past, we ran into some financial problems because (1) we did not budget for expenses, (2) we had no savings set aside, and (3) we often spent more than we earned--either because of mismanagement or unforeseen expenses/emergencies. Happily, a couple of years ago, we took a personal finance managing class that equipped us with the knowledge and insight we needed to change our habit and become good money managers. Now, (1) we have a budget and we stick to it; (2) we set aside savings every month for large upcoming expenses and for emergency deductibles; and (3) we don't buy much on credit at all, and when we do, we pay off any credit card statement balances by due date.<br><br>I will be happy to answer any other questions you may have. Thank you for your consideration and  support. Your help  is much appreciated. Have a great day!<br>\n",

      "The proceeds from the proposed loan will be used to pay-off the existing balance on a credit card and close the account. The interest on the outstanding balance is currently 0%, but will increase to 18.99% next month. The proposed loan will have a more favorable pricing structure.  A majority of my revolving and some installment debt is the result of a large tax liability (capital gains). My financial advisor urged me to pull from all of my personal resources in order to pay the liability as soon as possible, so I used my savings (except for emergency fund) and some debt to pay the liability in full. One of my installment loans is related to an executive graduate program. My former employer paid for the tuition and related expenses, subject to me remaining with the organization for 2 years after graduation. If I were to leave prior to that time a pro-rated balance of the tuition was to be converted into a note payable. I accepted a new position prior to the two year period, and the balance was converted to a note. My current employer reimburses me for both the monthly payment on the note (approximately $472), and the remaining expenses associated with the executive degree. I am currently in the process of paying off all debt, which should be accomplished by the 1st quarter of 2013. I will continue to pay down the higher interest facilities, and then roll the amount I was paying on an obligation once it has been paid off to the next obligation (snowball effect). My monthly budget provides sufficient excess funds from which IÂ’m able to pay debt at accelerated rate. I have been in the finance industry for 12+ years, focusing on senior secured lending, leveraged transactions, workout and restructure, and more recently consultation on M&A activity (primarily purchasing distressed assets). My unique skill set affords me a great deal of flexibility in both times of economic expansion and contraction. I have never been late on a payment, let alone defaulted on an obligation. The proposed loan will allow me to repay a significant portion of my exiting debt priced at a higher rate, and accelerate my plan to be debt free w/in the next few years.   \n",

Instead of paying high interest to large banks, I would rather pay a better interest back to the investors who deserve it.<br>\n",
      "  Borrower added on 11/15/11 > Hi,<br><br>My reason for this loan is two-fold: consolidate debt and reduce my interest rates.<br><br>I bought a house under my parents' name and needed to make a substantial down-payment by using cash advances. Some credit cards were at a 0% promotion and now have jumped to 24.99% APR. I am looking to consolidate my debt. My bills and rent are always paid on time. This will not only reduce my interest rate but consolidate my bills into one payment. My goal is to rent out this house as additional income on top of my full-time job. <br> Borrower added on 11/23/11 > To answer a few questions posed:<br><br>I have worked at my current place of employment for over 2 1/2 yrs. I pay all my bills on time and usually try to pay more than required. As stated above, I have two credit cards with @24.99% APR that I would like to pay off with the 18.25% loan.<br><br>The credit cards originally had a 0% APR for cash advances. This was used for a down payment on the house. It was not from frivolous spending. Before the cash advance, my credit cards had low balances which I'd pay off before the end of the month.<br><br>As for my monthly budget:<br><br>Housing cost: about $500 + $50 util. <br>Credit Cards: $500/mos. Which would be transferred to loan payments, when CC's are paid off with loan<br>Transportation: $100<br>Food/Misc.: $300<br><br>I hope this helps. Please feel free to send further questions. Thank you to those who have supported the loan!<br><br>\n",

The contracts that comprise my nearly $200,000 portfolio have been signed for three year extensions or are already self-renewing each year. Even if I were to lose any contracts, which is unlikely given my service ratings (and the fact that I've never once lost a contract), the owner of the company would not let me go.

Auto, rent and bill/utility payments constitute an additional 29.31%.<br/><br/>Furthermore, my employment is secure.  My employer has been in business for 8+ years.  I transitioned from a former employer in order to be with my current employer when the company was launched.

This will free up cash to finish paying off another debt in the next 90 days before returning to the US.  Excellent payment history - I see no need to stick with a store card (Sears, 17%, used to replace roof on home thus increasing value of property; purchased at $210K in 2009) and a regular credit card (Chase, 23%, they raised it years ago and I have never been able to argue them down, regardless of impeccable payment history and credit score).  I opted for the short-term 3 year loan; I see no need to extend payments if you don't need to.  I appreciate Lending Clubs ease of use, so I opted to use LC again (I have a current loan at 6% for an emergency pool cave in/repair last summer) after failing to find another option that can compare to the quick financing, initial interaction with potential lenders (Q&amp;A when initially funding the loan), and competitive rates.  Other options on the web did not meet the threshold to satisfy the two debts I listed above, or their interest rates were equally abysmal.  I hope this answers some questions up front.

And this loan will be an important key in the success of my life changing goals.  I plan to use these funds to pay down credit card debt, student loan debt and I am also thinking about using a small portion for something very personal that will change my life forever.  I know I am going to be a great borrower due to the fact that, as I have stated, I take great pride in my financial well-being.  Also, I work for a bank in a department that deals with helping homeowners.  This experience has without a doubt opened my eyes to what can happen when money and budgets are not managed correctly and/or logically, therefore I know what it truly means to be a good borrower to any financial institution that lends money.  My Monthly budget is a simple one, most of my debt is from a couple of credit cards, 1 installment loan, student loans and my rent, which is not a lot because I have 2 roommates and that helps to keep the living expenses down considerably.  I have a car that is completely paid off and is in great condition.  I would be more than happy to answer any questions regarding my monthly budget if more detail is required.  As I have stated I am employed at a Bank, and I feel that after 7 years of working at the bank, I know I have a very stable job.  I was just recently promoted to a much more important role, and this promotion is more proof of how stable my job is and also demonstrates a little more of how I will be a good borrower.

This year, I have paid down $7,000 on the principal along with the monthly payments of $900.  The purpose of this loan is to pay the balance of the principal requirement now which will create a larger margin of cash flow for the next 3 years.  The property is not upside down.  I purchased it for $175,000 and owe $102,000.  They did not require an appraisal for the refinance.  All three units have been remodeled since I purchased the property.  One occupant has been with us since 2006.  The other 2 have lived there since 2007.  They are stable tenants and always pay their rent on time.<br/><br/>Some information about me:  I work full-time for an investment firm in their technology area.

I am a Federal Employee (22 years) and have incredibly strong job security, which is rare in these days.  I track all my expenses in Quicken, know my budget and always stay within my means.  I use credit cards only for online purchases, flights, or major purchases.  Unfortunately, I have had to make several major purchases over the past year.  I did not have fix rate credit cards, and with today's economy, many of them increased my interest rate by as much as 13%.  Also, as far as being responsible, I keep to a tight budget, and use Quicken to track my expenses so I can work out averages and budget my expenses.  I do not spend more than I can afford to pay, and when I do have to apply for loans it usually is only for a better &quot;financial strategy&quot; to obtain a lower interest rate.  For instance, last year I refinanced my home as I could lower my interest rate by 2.5%.  .<br/>\n",

On a more personal level, however, there is no teacher like experience - and having accumulated the amount of debt that I have (&quot;righteous debt&quot; though it is - surgeries for my dog, framing for my photos for an opening, road trips to MI to see my family...) has taught me what a burden it is to be paying x amount of dollars to 5 or 6 different places each month...organization is not my strong suit - although I've somehow managed thus far. Anyhow, I have a true motivation to live debt free, or at least with a minimal amount. Streamlining my debt into one loan makes it so much more efficient and organized!<br/>\n",

I even bought a house! During college, I racked up a few grand in credit card debt, and I've just never really been able to get ahead of it thanks to lots of bills and also high interest rates (15.9%!). One of my projects lately has been to get control of my funds and set up different accounts so that I can get the best &quot;bang for my buck,&quot; so to speak, so Mint.com pointed me toward this site as a good way to pay off my credit card debt at a lower interest rate. <br/><br/>To make you feel good about lending to me: I have never been late on any payments, and the idea of defaulting on a loan horrifies me beyond belief. I make enough money to pay all my bills just fine and still have money left over to do some &quot;fun&quot; things. This loan is simply for me to save a few dollars in interest. Rest assured, I am safe to lend to.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your consideration! Please feel free to ask any questions - I will answer them as quickly as I can.<br/>\n",

I was not careless with my credit cards, but used them when I was out of work to pay the bills like mortgage, car, etc.  Before that happened, I had a few credit cards that had large balances on them due to unexpected travel expenses and medical expenses.  I was paying them down without a problem, but since I was out of work and had to use the others, it has become more and more difficult. Due to the large balances on the cards, the credit card companies have raised their fees and interest to a point where none of my payment is applied to the balances, just the fees.  If my payments had been applied to the balances, I would not be in such a desperate situation today.  <br/><br/>My salary should be enough to support my family and give them what they need.  It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating when most of my paycheck goes to the credit card companies each month and not even the balances.  I am a hard worker.  I have only been able to do patchwork repairs on our  house instead of large repairs that need to be done.  I need a large loan to wipe out this debt that I am drowning in plus have some extra to put into savings as a cushion for emergency medical expenses or repair bills, then I can build on that.  <br/><br/>I am extremely frustrated with my situation and have tried to get bank loans but have been condescendingly turned down due to the amount of debt.  One person even asked me why would anyone give me a loan to replace one debt with another.  I work 6 days a week.  My family sees how hard I work, and I know they sense how disappointed I am at times.  I want to set an example.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that all your hard work still doesn&rsquo;t get you ahead.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that if you are in a bind, nobody will help you.  They have continued to raise their percentage and fees and now minimum payments to the point that I am no longer able to make the minimum payments. I need help.  This loan would help my family from drowning in debt and get us back on our feet.  I would love to be able to have this hold on me gone.  I would also love to someday help somebody else out of debt as a thank you, since I know how it can affect every aspect of your life.

      "  Borrower added on 09/17/11 > WHY INVEST IN ME?<br/> <br/>Short of providing a copy of my Credit Report, I have provided you, the Investor, with a complete evaluation.  As I have fully disclosed, my successful participation over the last 21/2 years in a DMP has resulted in the &ldquo;pay-off&rdquo; of over $31,000 of debt since January 1, 2009.  Notwithstanding the reported closure/cancellation of participating accounts,<br/><br/>My &ldquo;credit worthiness&rdquo; has been established over the course of my long-reported credit history.<br/>Particularly over the last few years, I have consistently maintained &ldquo;responsible credit management practices&rdquo; that clearly demonstrate that I possess the discipline and income capacity to meet my past, present and future financial obligations.  Investors&rsquo; review of my posted credit history will confirm my consistent payment history.   .  <br/><br/>In addition, my posted current salary is based on well established professional employment (civil service), which provides the type of income stability that investors should demand to assure a very acceptable return on your investment, as contractually agreed to.   <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 09/20/11 > DMP - FULL DISCLOSURE<br/><br/>On January 1, 2009, I held 11 active and &ldquo;current&rdquo; credit card/installment accounts totaling slightly over $38,000.  I wanted to consolidate the 11 separate account payments into one single, manageable payment to be made under better terms agreed to by the 11 creditors.  After evaluating my options, I determined that, rather than try to deal with each creditor individually; I &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; and &ldquo;responsibly&rdquo; entered into a Debt Management Plan (DMP) with the 11 creditors.  Under the DMP, the 11 participating creditors agreed to reduce interest rates and min. payments&hellip;and the 11 separate account payments were consolidated into one manageable payment of $1,174/mon. (includes $35/mon. fee)&hellip;.. Part of the deal agreed to by the 11 creditors under their accepted participation in the DMP, was the cancellation of the 11 &ldquo;current&rdquo; accounts, and updating of my Credit Report by including the following statement for each participating account:  &ldquo;account canceled/closed by credit grantor&rdquo;.  Therefore, my Credit Report now shows 11 &ldquo;current&rdquo; accounts with this inserted statement.  However, my Credit Report now also reflects the fact that, 8 of the 11 accounts are reported as; &ldquo;paid-in-full ($0 balance)&rdquo;, as a result of my payment of over $31,000 during the last 21/2 years.  <br/><br/>The remaining 3 of the 11 &ldquo;current&rdquo; accounts have a total remaining balance of about $7,800.  The remaining &ldquo;current&rdquo; DMP accounts include:<br/>BofA Gold Option ($4,670) &ndash; req. min. $204/mon. @ 10% roi.<br/>Wells Fargo Visa ($720) &ndash; req. min. $88/mon @ 10% roi.<br/>Wells Fargo Personal ($2,380) &ndash; req. min. $125/mon. @ 10% roi.<br/> Borrower added on 09/23/11 > FINAL THOUGHTS FOR INVESTORS' CONSIDERATION<br/><br/>See It.......Feel It.......Trust It<br/>null\n",

I've since grown up and learned much about managing one's personal finances. I need to clean up my act and get things under control. I strongly prefer not to negotiate with my lenders / banks to bring my debt load down because A, I can afford to pay it off in full and honor my commitments. And B, I've never made a late payment. As far as my repayment record goes, I'm spotless. I also usually try to pay a little extra each month but with this much debt and the big minimum payments, that was becoming increasingly more difficult. I don't want this stain on my credit history.

I will then work to pay off this loan early so that I will have complete financial freedom and start my life that has been drastically delayed to large amounts of debt at such a young age.  I appreciate all of you who invest and give me that chance to become debt free in 36 months or less!<br/> Borrower added on 09/14/11 > I want to thank all of you that have help to fund this loan so far.  If you a considering helping, please understand that you are helping get rid of High interest debts have controlled my life for about 15 years. Right at the time that the end was in reach, the banks made unsecured loans for debt consolidation almost impossible. This loan really needs to be fully funded to allow me to pay all debt off and have one controllable payment. Twice a month I currently sit up for hours on end doing bill after bill. This loan will make things become manageable for me again. For every dollar that you invest, you get your financial return, but in turn I start a path to a debt free life.  I wish I had known about this program sooner. So if you are considering helping, please do.  Your investment will not be a waste! Thank-you investors, if you know someone that can help, please pass the message along.  God Bless!<br/> Borrower added on 09/15/11 > I've borrowed unsecured loans before which have helped in my process of reducing the large amount of debt I ran up as a young adult. These loans were always, paid when due or even paid off ealier than schedule.  Running up debt is not has it's consequences, it takes years and years to finally pay off.  With this loan, I am not taken on more debt, just transfering to one lender location.  This will allow me to have a little extra money for savings and will allow me to make payments in excess of the amount due to pay off loan in about two and half years.<br/>\n",

Once I obtain this money, I will close all of my credit accounts and will only keep one credit card open for emergencies as this is the card that I have had the most longevity with (since 1996). My mortgage (1150), my student loans (130 per month), my BOA grad school loan (450) and my credit cards totalling $1050 plus utilities and living expenses are my monthly expenses.<br/> Borrower added on 09/12/11 > I simply want to consolidate and pay off everything in one payment with lower interest and structured term. Great, secure, steady employment and payment history and deep appreciation for the opportunity combine to make this a good investment!<br/>\n",
      "  Borrower added on 09/06/11 > I would like to secure a debt consolidation loan. I took one out last year through Lending Club, which went very well. I have always made the payments on time and kept up other debt in the meanwhile. I had hoped to have the current loan paid off within the next six months. Unfortunately, due to matters beyond my control and which I am not at liberty to disclose, I was forced to take on additional debt over the course of the last six months. Now that the matter has been resolved, I can continue to pay off the existing loan and also pay down the new debt accrued at a fairly aggressive rate; however, I would prefer to secure a new loan for a slightly larger amount and longer term. My goal is to pay off the loan in 3 years or preferably less. With that said, I am requesting a five-year loan with the idea the unexpected can happen so having a lower monthly amount due to begin with will allow me to keep money in savings for the unknown and not have to rely on credit cards. I will also try to pay more than is due each month in order to pay off the loan as quickly and efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>Using this new loan I am committed to: paying off the existing Lending Club loan which has been open approximately 11 months; pay off all outstanding credit card and personal loan debt, and leave myself with only this new monthly loan, a small auto loan, monthly rent and some associated bills, such as heating, etc.<br/><br/>I would be willing to agree to a loan of a lesser amount. However, for the sake of credit upkeep and repair, my aim is for the full amount in order to close out any other existing loans, and pay off all existing credit card debt.<br/> Borrower added on 09/14/11 > Note to potential investors: I currently have a Lending Club loan which has been open approximately 11 months and always paid on time. That loan is $415/month approximately. The new loan would pay off that 3-year loan and all other debt. The new terms would be only $10 more per month for a 5-year loan. I hope this very small ($10) adjustment per month and my history of paying this and all debt 100% on time will help you in your investment decision.  I will pay off the new loan, if received, before the 5-year term. The extended timeframe is merely a safety net, which allows me to pay the minimum due from time to time, though I plan to pay more than due each month 90% of the time, if not always.<br/>\n",

      "  Borrower added on 09/04/11 > Outdoor lifestyle apparel is a rapidly growing segment of the retail industry. Some of these products that are particularly tailored to coastal fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts have seen tremendous growth in popularity in the coastal regions. Many retailers carry these products all across this area, but few offer any selection of size. Some offer outdated models and prints while others just carry a fairly limited supply. Most of the customers in this region have never had the opportunity to see and purchase the vast selection of merchandise that these popular brands offer. That is where our business comes in.<br/><br/>Our company is a retail store that is designed to provide the coastal outdoor apparel and merchandise that so many people seek in one of the region&rsquo;s premier retail centers. Our collection of the most popular brands will be the largest selection in this area by far. We plan to offer the biggest selection so that every customer who has a passion for these brands will only think of one place for their coastal outdoor apparel needs: us. In a market with a lot of competitors we plan to stand out by being completely devoted to this segment. This is a niche market, and we plan on being the retailer that can serve this niche market the best. We plan on focusing on this market segment and providing a depth in product line with which other retailers cannot compete while staying competitive in pricing. Since we will carry the largest selection of products from these wholesalers, we will be able to compete with even the big retailers on price. With competitive prices and the largest selection in the area, we are confident that we will be the preferred choice of many of the customers who love these brands and apparel.<br/><br/>Our store concept is one of a kind. While there may be similar stores in other geographical areas, there are no stores of this nature and this size in this region. With this uniqueness we plan to further differentiate ourselves from the competition by the way we do business. We plan to have a simple nautical and fishing theme as our store d&eacute;cor, something very different from other retailers. Our staff is to be friendly and attentive to help our customers in whatever they need. We also realize that although much of our clothing apparel is targeted to males, females do the majority of shopping and purchasing in a typical family. That is why we will make an effort to reach out to these customers with a large selection of women&rsquo;s coastal apparel that cannot be matched elsewhere. We have a passion for these clothes and brands ourselves. When people are passionate with what they do and what they sell, their passion is evident. With our selection of brands, depth of product lines, emphasis in customer service, good location, and a passion in what we do and sell, we are set to become the retailer of choice for coastal outdoor enthusiasts.<br/><br/>I will gladly answer any questions about the business in a timely manner. My formal education background is a Bachelor's degree in Business Management with a concentration in Entrepreneurship from the University of Alabama.

With the consolidation loan the payments will be the same as I pay on the cards monthly and it will allow me to actually pay them off.

D., and I am asking for this loan to refinance my credit card debt. I get a monthly stipend that is guarenteed for the next 3 years. I could pay it off vigilently for the next year, but I've done the math: I wouldn't save that much, and I would have to constantly be calculating average daily balances in my head for different possible scenarios, and I prefer to be focusing on my studies. So for this I am glad to pay you this reasonable interest rate!<br/>My monthly stipend is more than enough for my apartment, phone, food, textbooks, and some more which I will pay off this loan with. Like I said I am a graduate student, which doesn't have any overhead costs (besides textbooks), and it doesn't leave me much time to go out and spend more money ;-) .<br/>Well thanks again for reviewing this, I look forward to dealing with you.<br/> Borrower added on 09/01/11 > More details on my monthly expenditures:<br/><br/>Monthly Expenditures Total: 697.25<br/>337.25 Rent<br/>35 Cell Phone<br/>125 Utilities<br/>200 Food<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Hope this helps your decision!<br/>\n",

Monies will go towards acquiring several printers, plotters, and supplies.  <br/><br/>I currently am the owner of a computer service company which I mainly do programming for my customers.  I have been doing this for 7 1/2 years and it is still going very strong so repayment will not be an issue.

      "  Borrower added on 08/30/11 > I am seeking funds for an endurance sports supplement start-up business. I majored in mathematics at the University of California and have a background in sports nutrition. I am currently employed in financial planning; therefore I value risk management. Approximately half of the funds I am seeking will be earmarked towards product (original formula) acquisition and the other half will be earmarked towards advertising/marketing and used as an emergency cushion. I currently have approximately 10 months worth of expenses in cash reserves and I am planning to continue to work until this start-up stabilizes and becomes profitable. I have low overhead costs and I am the sole owner.<br/>My target consumer will be endurance athletes such as marathoners, triathletes, Ironmans, and the like. I am an ultramarathoner (podium (top three) finishes overall and in my division in three races over the last year: 100 mile, 50 mile, and 50 kilometers) and have tried most of the supplement products on the market. Many competitors in the sports nutrition industry offer multiple products (carbohydrate drink, electrolyte salt pills, protein drink) and/or products with insufficient nutrition for prolonged exercise. My business offers two comprehensive products: one for pre-/intra-workout exercise, and another for post-exercise. A simplified business model will eliminate the &ldquo;too many choices&rdquo; conundrum for the consumer. Approximately 25% of this business has already been funded, the business website is live, and the first product is on track to be shipped in less than two and a half months. <br/>Please let me know if you have any questions.

      " The primary reason for this loan is to cover a portion of the final 5% of the principle of our home loan and closing costs.  We are trying to purchase at the extremely low rate of 3%.  This would be converting our existing land contract into traditional financing thru a local bank.  Current land contract interest is 8%.  Our current payment is $3,100 monthly.  We have been approved for a 95% loan, at 3% for thirty years (5 yr arm fixed, then adjustable, max 8% apr for life of loan after five years).  PMI is waived on this loan.  Our new payment, including property tax, would be $1,900, thus a net decrease in monthly mortgage payment of $1,200 if we can move forward with traditional financing.  We would save upwards of $18,000 yearly on interest alone.<br> We do have some revolving debt, and have been placing most of our extra cash into paying down this revolving debt (which we have decreased by 50% over the last year, and we will continue to do so at an even higher rate if we can attain this loan), but because of aggressively paying down revolving debt, we have only accumulated a small amount of savings.  Thus we are asking for this loan to help us \"re-finance\" out of our land contract. <br><br>  Thank you for your time.\n",

      "  Borrower added on 08/22/11 > Originally took out Lending Club loan last November to wrap up as much CC debt as I could.  My income was slightly lower at the time so I couldn't get the full amount needed to consolidate.  My income is better now and since Citi Bank and GE Money Bank raised my interest rate on my 2 remaining credit cards (only 2 with balances that revolve), I'd like to just &quot;wrap those up&quot; with the current Lending Club  loan I have (which I pay on time with no problem every month). <br/><br/>My FICO:<br/><br/>Experian - 786 (per Wells Fargo internal)<br/>Equifax - 792 (per www.myfico.com)<br/>Transunion - 791 (per www.myfico.com)<br/><br/>Breakdown:<br/><br/>$18,000 total<br/>(10,511 to pay off/refi Lending Club)<br/>(4800 to pay Citi) - Charging me 18.99% interest.  They &quot;kindly&quot; lowered it from 26.99%. How nice. <br/>(1700 to pay GE Money Bank) - Interest rate is 23.99%. <br/><br/><br/>Why 60 month term? <br/>-Flexibility is key.  I'm in the financial service industry and nothing is ever certain as you can imagine.  As much as I'd love to go 36 months at a lower rate, I'd feel safer doing a 60 month term just in case.  I have enough in reserves to cover a $400 payment for this loan for 12 months along with fixed expenses.  <br/><br/>Why didn't I ask for the 18k the first time?<br/>-Great question. To be honest, I was a little naive and just assumed I wouldn't get approved.  I also wasn't sure how Lending Club worked and was tentative to &quot;put all my eggs in one basket&quot; so to speak.  In hindsight, it wasn't the smartest decision as I've ended up paying more in interest due to my tentativeness.  Now I'm ready to wipe all of these credit cards off! <br/><br/>Is my job safe?<br/>- Wells Fargo has been around since 1852. I am doing very well here and out of all the banks, Wells Fargo seems to be the most stable in terms of job security.  <br/><br/>Why Should You Invest In Me?<br/>- Because I'm essentially a guaranteed return.

      "  Borrower added on 08/13/11 > I accrued my current credit card debt easing the burden of obtaining my undergraduate and graduate degrees.  Shortly after graduation, before I could make significant headway on my debt, congress passed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD) in 2009.  As a response to this legislation, the interest rates on many of my cards skyrocketed, even though I have never been late on a payment and have always paid more than minimum.  This event made making real debt reduction even more difficult.<br/><br/>Securing this credit card consolidation loan will be a concrete step forward in improving my financial situation, as I will use it to pay off the credit cards that &quot;adjusted&quot; to the higher rates in 2009.  As a result, my outlook will greatly improve in at least three ways: 1) The interest rate reduction will result in greater monthly positive cash flow to service the remainder of my debts and 2) The transition of revolving credit to non-revolving will improve my credit score, which will allow me to 3) seek interest rate reductions on my other credit cards.  Even if #3 is unsuccesful, the positive impact of the other noted effects are too good to ignore at this time.<br/><br/>As far as my employment outlook, I have been with my current employer for the past 2 1/2 years, during which time I have been promoted once and have been told that I will be again this year.  I have strategically positioned myself in the company as a critical asset to several high-profile projects, which greatly reduces the prospect for lay-off, even in the current economic/political climate.  However, given the worst case scenario of job loss, my prospects for securing replacement employment are almost guaranteed, given my experience in the defense industry, my skill set, the location in which I live, and my security clearance.<br/><br/>My current monthly debt obligations, outside of the balances that would be paid off with this loan's proceeds, are:<br/>$2294 - Mortgage<br/>$750 - Credit cards<br/>$394 - Student loan<br/>$258 - Auto loan<br/><br/>Please note that there were significant contributing factors to my accrual of this revolving debt; but unfortunately I have been informed that I cannot include these in my loan description, as they may give hints to information that is disallowed by law in loan considerations.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration in funding this request.<br/>\n",

I have gathered info on potential business competitors, seen their rates, and what they offer, and though I am starting out small, I see myself having a greatly beneficial edge, in that 1, I am the only company to offer multiple services (acting classes, headshots, film equipment rentals, etc.) at one location. <br/>     With this loan, I will be able to invest in various advertising campaigns, (online, newspaper, flyers, etc.) as well as business cards, brochures, outdoor signs, and a new website.

I would have paid the amount; however, I did not know the amount was owed until it was too late.

This past year I had too many large expenses come up (needing new tires, my cat was hospitalized twice, an expensive medical procedure with a portion not covered by insurance).

      "I am currently a Registered Nurse, but my dream has always been to go to medical school. Prior to attending the University of Maryland, I would like to consolidate my credit card debt.  I have been working as a RN in the Surgical ICU of a well known Maryland hospital for the past 13 years. Additionally, I work part-time as an emergency room RN for a neighborhood hospital in Washington, DC. I have held this part-time position for the past 12 years. I believe my income and my 750+ FICO score, make me an ideal candidate for this loan.  I have four revolving credit card accounts which will be paid off with this loan. The loan will afford me the opportunity to greatly reduce my monthly expenses. As a result I will be able to work fewer hours and focus effectively on completing medical school.  My income while in school ($54,000), will be more than enough to cover my monthly expenses and the repayment of this loan.  Monthly Expenses:  Rent (utilities included): $600 (NOTE: Rent will be $0 once I begin school. I will be living with family to be closer to the campus)  Car payment: $600  Insurance: $120  Phone and food:$300  Thank you for your time and interest in funding my loan.

I had to use credit cards, high interest credit cards at that, to help my brother and grandmother deal with severe financial troubles over the past couple of years. They are now financially stable, and I do not have to provide any additional support for them in the future. I can pay my current bills on my current budget. However, I am paying a ridiculous amount of interest on a few credit cards. I am looking to pay those cards down to reduce the amount of interest I pay each month. My only credit flaws are a public record for a fraudulent claim filed by a former landlord (from 7 years ago), and high debt-income ratio. The debt-income ratio will greatly improve over the next few months as I concentrate my resources to pay off my debt. I live in a house that was a gift from my father, so I have no mortgage payment, and I own two vehicles free and clear.

      "  Borrower added on 08/07/11 > Since I have only 5 days left and barely near 20% funded, perhaps I need to be a bit more specific as to why I am trying to consolidate my debt which includes a Lending Club loan.  Looking back I should have listed a loan for more than I did the last time.  I did not pay off one credit card which was at 2.99%, but I was able to double the payments every month and had planned to have the card paid off the same time the Lending Club loan was paid.  Since that time however, with the economy the way it is, I have had to cut back on the payments I make on the credit card and I will no longer be able to have it paid off in 3 yrs.  I'm finding that it is much easier to budget if I had just one &quot;loan&quot; payment per month.  This 24,000 will enable me to pay off my 3 yr Lending Club loan, the dept credit cards (which both have small balances) and the big credit card amount and still have money left to cover incidentals and adding more to my savings each month.  I realize this will add an additional 2 years to my planned retirement, but then again, the economy might improve in a couple of years and I will be able to make bigger payments to pay this loan off earlier.  I have managed to handle my bills in a timely manner, but I would like to make my life a little easier.  Thank you for your interest.<br/>\n",

      "Hello, all. The purpose of this loan is to provide the final tranche of funding for a long-planned, extensive interior renovation of my home. I purchased the home in October 2009, and got a great price because of the remodeling that was needed.   The person I bought the house with took off four months after we moved in, leaving me with the mortgage (I hold full title to the house), and in the financial scramble that followed, my credit rating took a hit, as I took out a bunch of credit cards and had to carry balances.  Since then, I have landed a job that pays more than both of our combined salaries when we bought the place. I am an in-house lobbyist for a clean energy company, in a senior position with a stable, annual salary.   I have a monthly disposable income of $4700--after mortgage payments. I have a tenant to help defray the mortgage, and this renovation will help make the house more comfortable for two people who do not share a bedroom. Right now the layout for the kitchen and common areas are cramped and poorly thought out--the house was originally flipped.  I've done as much work on the house as I can with my own hands--extensive landscaping and a new patio. Now it is time to work on the inside, and I am no plumber or carpenter or electrician. Because I haven't been in the house long, I'm not eligible for a home equity line of credit, but I do have a homeowner's loan and a personal loan from a credit union--however, banks are conservative these days and my credit score is still recovering from last year, so it is not quite enough.  I am turning to LendingClub to put me over the top for the renovation which this house needs, so it can be the place I envisioned when I bought it nearly two years ago. Home values are going up in my neighborhood, but I need this work to allow my home to express its true worth, and to be more livable for me and a tenant, as well to be more attractive any renters or sellers in the future should I ever move.   But I'm not planning to move for a while. I love my house. But the tiny kitchen and bathroom are starting to drive me bonkers. Thanks to all potential investors for helping me realize the wonderful home I have been waiting for.   I am happy to answer any questions, and thank you.  Update:   Thanks to everyone who has invested so far--this is an exciting process, and I hope we can get all the way to the goal in these last few days.   \n",

For prospective investors, let me outline my plans:<br/><br/>WIth funds received, I have 6 low limit credit cards with APRs between 15.99-21.99 that will be paid in full &amp; closed.  The total of these accounts are $7,100. Paying off the cards I have with the highest rates is a smart move - saving me from paying extra interest down the road. The Lending Club interest rate affords me this savings.<br/><br/>That leaves +/- $3,500 after loan fees. This amount will be used to pay 2 cards with balances that I will continue to work off. The APRs on these cards are approximately 11.99. <br/><br/>The reason for balances on these cards are due to:<br/>a) Relocation to NYC (go figure... nyc is not a cheap place to live!)<br/>b) Medical <br/><br/>As noted, I have had ZERO non payments, judgments, defaults, or late payments since my credit reporting history began. The extra savings affords me to get out of debt quicker, pay off my Lending Club loan quicker, and start the path of saving and debt free living. <br/><br/>Thanks for your time!<br/>\n",

We believe the only thing slowing us down is our current location. Right now we are located just outside of town with VERY little traffic.

I am also a contract employee at a manufacturing assembly plant.  To give everyone a piece of mind on repayment.

The reason for my request is twofold: (1) I am one payment away from paying the balance of two short-term debts. The monthly payments on these debts are more than the monthly payments needed to service the monthly payments for the requested loan. As the sole co-signer for a college loan for I am responsible for a past due balance on one of two loans which requires ongoing payments although my son is still enrolled as a full time student. The loan I am requesting will be used to cover the delinquency on the loan which is over 120 days past due. <br/><br/>(2) The only delinquency on my credit profile is related to this past due payments on the loan and has had a negative impact on my credit rating. When many of my creditors (particularly the banks) lowered my overall available credit (in one case by as high as 90%) to levels close to my overall balances my credit rating was negatively impacted. This put my overall balances closer to my overall credit limits although I did not incur any additional debt. With just this, one-change creditors drastically affected the credit profile of many consumers who were otherwise in good standing. I will use the balance of the loan to cover outstanding medical bills not covered by my medical and dental insurance.<br/>\n",

My best friend and business partner has a cell phone bill, drives a scooter (paid for with cash and has a $20 per month insurance bill), and is pursuing his MBA. He is totally immersed in the world of business and believes in providing for the business first. So other than books for school and maybe an occassional quick bite from a restaurant his debt is minimal as well. We whole-heartedly believe in living well below our means. Our life is our company, and we enjoy the sweat we put into it while watching it grow. We see no need in going through banks to apply for business loans with minimums of $50,000-$150,000. Those amounts do not match the steady and calculated pace of our business. After Lending Club was featured on CNBC earlier this year, my partner and I knew we were in the among great company, and chose to come back to where we started for capital supplementation.<br/>\n",

      "  Borrower added on 07/18/11 > With this loan, I can COMPLETELY pay off 3 credit cards, consolidating them into ONE payment. I have 3 credit cards, all of whom have recent raised the interest rates...and worse, these rates continue to be variable. I apologize if I am repeating myself. I can easily make this monthly payment. It is only approx $100 more than the payments I am making now, and will allow me to be completely debt free in a maximum of 5 years (probably sooner) as opposed to perhaps 20 years with these credit cards. I honestly do not know if I am allowed to list the cards and the rates I am paying..one such post was censored. I have 3 days and 18 hours left. 148 investors have contributed approximately $47 dollars each in a little over 10 days. I need some people (several, in fact) to invest $1,000 or more....I believe my official approval is mere hours away.  The debt was accumulated during and post college and now I am in a senior management position with my company. This type of loan is PERFECT for me. but at the rate it is getting funded, I won't receive the money. Check my credit score. It is really excellent, and the reason it isn't higher is because I had zero debt until I was in my 20s. I HAD no credit history. Then I acquired debt in college and after college, moving away from home, etc. I hope this passes LC standards of what I can disclose. I have zero mortgage and I have zero car payments.

With the leftover money I would consolidate some of my bills and actually be paying less than owed for the amount monthly.

      "  Borrower added on 07/01/11 > I have completely remodeled a restaurant and bar on a busy world famous beach. We are ready to open our doors but need the capital behind us to insure success from day 1. We have a celebrity chef on staff. I have owned and ran 2 successful restaurants a few years back and sold both of them. I am a very responsible hard working person and usually pay cash for everything. I have had loans and credit cards in the past and always paid on time and over the minimum due. I am very secure in my job as a store manager. I have been in this industry for over 27 years working for the same group of owners for this time period. My budget is approx 2400.00 per month for mortgage, utilities and incidentals. The restaurant also has a very low overhead since we have free rent for 2 years after opening day. After the 2 year free rent it will increase to 1000.00 per month which is very cheap for the area and size. We will open the day after the loan is funded. Thank you for helping us achieve our goal.<br/>\n",

This credit card has been paid off slowly from 22k to 7780 in a year and a half. The problem is everytime I make a huge payment, the credit card company lowers the credit limit to whatever I paid. For instance I made a 10k payment. Then they lowered the limit 10k. This affects my credit score and debt to ratio. I have never been late on a payment.  The credit card company claims that they have been affected by the economy and those whom filed chapter 13/7. So they are lowering credit limits to off set their loss. It's upsetting. I worked hard to have my credit score be in the excellent range, I never asked for a credit increase. They increased it, and when I used it with the intention to pay off in 2 years. They are now lowering it as I pay off, which affects me. I will cancel this card if my loan is funded. I have had that account for almost 13 years and this is the thanks I get from them. All the interest I have paid to them throughout the years has paid my debt probably 3 times over<br/>\n",

I have paid down some of that debt since graduating but if I consolidated my debts I believe my credit score would improve and I would save money. I think my rates on my credit cards would also decline if I consolidated since my credit score would improve.<br/><br/>Credit Quality:<br/>- I have never paid a bill late<br/>- My credit score is low because of my limited credit history<br/>- Generally speaking, in a typical year by bonus is equal to my base salary. My bonus is paid in January each year. Last year I earned a little over $125,000 in base and bonus combined. This year my base has increased to over $100K <br/><br/>Expected Payoff:<br/>- I can easily meet the monthly payments on this 3 year loan. After paying all my loan interest payments, rent, and recurring bills each month I have about $2,500 of disposable income each month. <br/><br/>Savings:<br/>I have about $30K is my IRA which constitutes the majority of my net worth but that is not liquid. If I lost my job, which I believe is highly unlikely, I would be able to access some of that IRA without penalty to make sure I could pay my bills like the interest on this loan.<br/> Borrower added on 06/23/11 > Additional Details:<br/>I was not specific enough when I talked about how much debt I had coming out of college.  After my 1st year bonus I retired all of my student loans.  So in my first year I paid down about $10,000 of student loan debt.  Last bonus I paid down about $5,000 of credit card debt.  Today I have roughly $12,000 of remaining credit card debt with interest rates between 10% and 29%.  I also have a car loan for a certified pre-owned car I purchased last year for my commute to work.  On that loan my interest rate is 3.9% and my monthly payment is under $300 a month.<br/><br/>Please submit additional questions as they arise.

Thank you for your favorable consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 06/27/11 > I would like to add, that my long, positive credit history supports the fact that I honor my financial committments, having never once defaulted on a debt.

As a result, I have never been late in my five years of owning the home.  In addition, I proudly own a home in full.  So while I have collateral, I would rather not tap into these secure assets, and instead remain disciplined to pay off my credit card debt in 5 years while my assets continue to appreciate.<br/>Thank you again for the response and the favorable consideration.<br/>\n",
